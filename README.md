parelation.js
=============

ActiveRecordâ€“like API to access backends built with [parelation gem](https://github.com/meskyanichi/parelation).

## Requirements

The only dependency for this library is jQuery. Your backend should obviously be built with parelation gem.

## Usage

First, require parelation.js and jQuery in your HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="../dist/parelation.min.js"></script>
```

Then, define your models:

```coffee
Ticket = Parelation.at("/tickets")
Cinema = Parelation.at("/cinemas")
```

Now, you can use them as you would with ActiveRecord (but in an asynchronous fashion):

```coffee
Ticket.where(name: "The Lord Of The Rings")
      .order(updated_at: "desc")
      .select("cost")
      .fetch()
      .done (tickets) -> console.log(tickets)
```

parelation.js will build your query lazily, executing it only when needed. When you call `fetch()` on a query, in fact, an AJAX GET is issued to the model location and a jQuery Deferred is returned.

```coffee
Ticket.fetch().done (tickets) -> console.log tickets
              .fail (error) -> console.warn error
```

Under the hood parelation.js just calls jQuery `$.get(...)`, converting your javascript query into a parelation compatible request.

## Supported Query Criterias

* `where`, `where_gt`, `where_gte`, `where_lt`, `where_lte`
* `order`
* `limit`
* `offset`
* `select`

`fetch` is not a query criteria, see the above section for further details.
